product is a single glider travelling in the opposite direction
to one of the original gliders. This is important in the proof
of the existence of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224237/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_u.htm#universalconstructor">universal constructor</a>, and in Bill Gosper's

<p><a name="killertoads">:</a><b>killer toads</b> A pair of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224237/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_t.htm#toad">toads</a> acting together so that they can eat
things. Here, for example, are some killer toads eating a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224237/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_h.htm#hwss">HWSS</a>.
Similarly they can eat a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224237/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_m.htm#mwss">MWSS</a> (but not a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224237/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_l.htm#lwss">LWSS</a>). For another
example see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224237/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_t.htm#twirlingttetsonsii">twirling T-tetsons II</a>. See also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224237/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_c.htm#candlefrobra">candlefrobra</a>.

<p><a name="kleinbottle">:</a><b>Klein bottle</b> As an alternative to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224237/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_t.htm#torus">torus</a>, it's possible to make
a finite Life universe in the form of a Klein bottle. The simplest
way to do this is to use an <i>m</i> &times; <i>n</i> rectangle with the top edge joined
to the bottom edge (as for a torus) and the left edge twisted and
joined to the right.
<p><a name="knightship">:</a><b>knightship</b> Any <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224237/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_s.htm#spaceship">spaceship</a> of type (2<i>m</i>,<i>m</i>)/<i>n</i>. Such spaceships do
exist (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224237/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_u.htm#universalconstructor">universal constructor</a>), but no concrete example is
known. A knightship must be asymmetric and its period must be at
least 6, which makes searching for them using programs like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224237/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_l.htm#lifesrc">lifesrc</a>
very difficult.
<p>By analogy with the corresponding fairy chess pieces, spaceships of
types (3<i>m</i>,<i>m</i>)/<i>n</i>, (3<i>m</i>,2<i>m</i>)/<i>n</i> and (4<i>m</i>,<i>m</i>)/<i>n</i> would presumably be called
camelships, zebraships and giraffeships, respectively. But no
examples of these are known either, and they are even more difficult
to search for.
