<p><a name="debruijndiagram">:</a><b>de Bruijn diagram</b> = <a href="lex_d.htm#debruijngraph">de Bruijn graph</a>
<p><a name="debruijngraph">:</a><b>de Bruijn graph</b> As applied to Life, a de Bruijn graph is a
graph showing which pieces can be linked to which other pieces
to form a valid part of a Life pattern of a particular kind.
<p>For example, if we are interested in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224441/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_s.htm#stilllife">still lifes</a>, then we could
consider 2&times;3 rectangular pieces and the de Bruijn graph would show
which pairs of these can be overlapped to form 3&times;3 squares in which
the centre cell remains unchanged in the next generation.
<p>David Eppstein's search program <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224441/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_g.htm#gfind">gfind</a> is based on de Bruijn
graphs.
<p><a name="deepcell">:</a><b>Deep Cell</b> A pattern by Jared James Prince, based on David Bell's
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224441/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_u.htm#unitlifecell">unit Life cell</a>, in which each unit cell simulates two Life cells,
in such a way that a Life universe filled with Deep Cells simulates
two independent Life universes running in parallel.
<p>In fact, a Life universe filled with Deep Cells can simulate
infinitely many Life universes, as follows. Let <i>P</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>P</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>P</i><sub>3</sub>, ...
be a sequence of Life patterns. Set the Deep Cells to run a
simulation of <i>P</i><sub>1</sub> in parallel with a simulation of a universe filled
with Deep Cells, with these simulated Deep Cells running a simulation
of <i>P</i><sub>2</sub> in parallel with another simulation of a universe filled with
Deep Cells, with these doubly simulated Deep Cells simulating <i>P</i><sub>3</sub> in
parallel with yet another universe of Deep Cells, and so on.
<p>Deep Cell is available from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224441/http://psychoticdeath.com/life.htm">http://psychoticdeath.com/life.htm</a>.
<p><a name="density">:</a><b>density</b> The density of a pattern is the limit of the proportion of
live cells in a (2<i>n</i>+1)&times;(2<i>n</i>+1) square centred on a particular cell as
<i>n</i> tends to infinity, when this limit exists. (Note that it does not
make any difference what cell is chosen as the centre cell. Also
note that if the pattern is finite then the density is zero.) There
are other definitions of density, but this one will do here.
<p>In 1994 Noam Elkies proved that the maximum density of a stable
pattern is 1/2, which had been the conjectured value. See the paper
listed in the bibliography. Marcus Moore provided a simpler proof
in 1995, and in fact proves that a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224441/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_s.htm#stilllife">still life</a> with an <i>m</i> &times; <i>n</i>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224441/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_b.htm#boundingbox">bounding box</a> has at most (<i>mn</i>+<i>m</i>+<i>n</i>)/2 cells.
<p>But what is the maximum average density of an oscillating pattern?
The answer is conjectured to be 1/2 again, but this remains unproved.
The best upper bound so far obtained is 8/13 (Hartmut Holzwart,
September 1992).
<p>The maximum possible density for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224441/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_p.htm#phase">phase</a> of an oscillating
pattern is also unknown. An example with a density of 3/4 is known
(see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224441/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_a.htm#agar">agar</a>), but densities arbitrarily close to 1 may perhaps be
possible.

following example vanishes in 130 generations, which is probably the
limit for patterns of 7 or fewer cells. Note that there is no limit
for higher numbers of cells - e.g., for 8 cells we could have a
glider heading towards an arbitrarily distant blinker.

hope of finding one which could be moved around a track. Because
drifters can be very small, they could be packed more tightly than
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224441/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_h.htm#herschel">Herschels</a>, and so allow the creation of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224441/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_o.htm#oscillator">oscillators</a> of periods
not yet attained, and possibly prove that Life is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224441/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_o.htm#omniperiodic">omniperiodic</a>.
Hickerson has found a number of components towards this end, but
it has proved difficult to change the direction of movement of a

Hickerson has had success using the same search program to find
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224441/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_e.htm#eater">eaters</a> with novel properties, such as that used in <a href="lex_d.htm#diuresis">diuresis</a>.
