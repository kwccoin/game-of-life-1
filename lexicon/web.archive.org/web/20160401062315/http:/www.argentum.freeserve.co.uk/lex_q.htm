in January 1998. (This is short for <a href="lex_q.htm#quetzalcoatlus">Quetzalcoatlus</a> and expresses
the fact that the gun was a very large <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324230753/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_h.htm#herschelloop">Herschel loop</a> that was not
an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324230753/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_e.htm#emu">emu</a>.) Shortly afterwards Leithner also built a p56 Quetzal
using a mechanism found by Noam Elkies for this purpose. In October
1998 Stephen Silver constructed a p55 Quetzal using Elkies' p5
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324230753/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_r.htm#reflector">reflector</a> of the previous month.
<p>Some of the more recent Quetzals are not Herschel loops, but are
instead short Herschel tracks firing several glider streams all but
one of which is reflected back to the beginning of the track to
create a new Herschel. Noam Elkies first had the idea of doing
this for the p55 case, and Stephen Silver constructed the resulting
gun shortly after building the original (much larger) p55 Quetzal.
Jason Summers later built a p54 version, which is more complicated
because the evenness of the period makes the timing problems
considerably more difficult.

named his p54 gun. Usually abbreviated to <a href="lex_q.htm#quetzal">Quetzal</a>, or simply Q
