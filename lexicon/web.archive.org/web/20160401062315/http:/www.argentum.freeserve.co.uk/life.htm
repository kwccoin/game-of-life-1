<h1>Stephen Silver's Life Page</h1>
This page concerns John Conway's Game of Life.
In the unlikely event that you've never heard of Life you should read
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401155310/http://www.math.com/students/wonders/life/life.html">this article by Paul Callahan</a>.
<h2>What Life stuff is available on this site?</h2>
<table align="center" summary="on this site">
<tr>
<td align="right"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401155310/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_home.htm">Life Lexicon</a>

You can also download my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401155310/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/ships.zip">collection of small spaceships</a>
(43K, updated 2004 Jan 12)

I hope to add further things to this site in the future.
But the Lexicon should keep you going for a while - it's over 250K.
<h2>Links to other Life pages</h2>
This is just a very small selection of Life pages.

<h2>Life Programs</h2>
Numerous programs have been written to run Life patterns.
Here are a few of the better ones.
<p>
<table align="center" summary="Life programs">

<h2>Collections of Life patterns</h2>
A number of large collections of Life patterns are available on the Internet.
Here are those I know about:
<p>
<table align="center" summary="pattern collections">
<tr>
<td align="right"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401155310/http://www.ibiblio.org/lifepatterns/lifep.zip">Alan Hensel's pattern collection</a>

</table>
<p>
These pattern collections use various different file formats.
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401155310/http://psoup.math.wisc.edu/Life32.html">Life32</a>
and
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401155310/http://www.mirwoj.opus.chelm.pl/ca/index.html">Cellebration</a>
can read all of them, but most other Life programs can only read some of them.
Dieter and Peter's collection in particular is in an unusual format (ProLife).
I've written a small <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401155310/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/plf2rle.zip">ProLife to rle converter</a>
(12K zip file containing C source and DOS executable).
An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401155310/http://home.interserv.com/~mniemiec/download.htm">rle to text converter</a>
is available from Mark Niemiec's site.
