patterns without suffering any permanent damage. (If it doesn't

The <a href="lex_e.htm#eater1">eater1</a> is a very common eater, and the term "eater" is often
used specifically for this object. Other eaters include <a href="lex_e.htm#eater2">eater2</a>,
<a href="lex_e.htm#eater3">eater3</a>, <a href="lex_e.htm#eater4">eater4</a> and even the humble <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402165536/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_b.htm#block">block</a>. (In fact the block
was the first known eater, being found capable of eating beehives
from a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402165536/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_q.htm#queenbee">queen bee</a>.) Another useful eater is shown below, feasting
on a glider.

<p><a name="eater1">:</a><b>eater1</b> (p1) Usually simply called an <a href="lex_e.htm#eater">eater</a>, and also called a
fishhook. Its ability to eat various objects was discovered by
Bill Gosper in 1971.

<p><a name="eater2">:</a><b>eater2</b> (p1) This <a href="lex_e.htm#eater">eater</a> was found by Dave Buckingham in the 1970s.
Mostly it works like the ordinary eater (see <a href="lex_e.htm#eater1">eater1</a>) but with two
slight differences that make it useful despite its size: it takes
longer to recover from each bite and it acts like an eater in two
directions. The first property means that, among other things, it
can eat a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402165536/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_g.htm#glider">glider</a> in a position that would destroy a fishhook. This
novel glider-eating action is occasionally of use in itself, and
combined with the symmetry means that an eater2 can eat gliders along
four different paths.

has a very different eating action from the <a href="lex_e.htm#eater1">eater1</a> and <a href="lex_e.htm#eater2">eater2</a>.
The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402165536/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_l.htm#loaf">loaf</a> can take bites out things, being flipped over in the

can't eat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402165536/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_g.htm#glider">gliders</a>, but it can be used for various other purposes.
The four NE-most centre cells regrow in a few generations after being
destroyed by taking a bite out of something.

These were found by David Bell in 1992, but the usefulness of
the edge-repair property wasn't recognised until July 1997. The

a <i>c</i>/4 spaceship can also be self-repairing. Stephen Silver noticed
that it could be used to delete beehives and, in November 2000, found
the smallest known <i>c</i>/4 spaceship with this edge-repair component - in
fact, two copies of the component:

<p><a name="emu">:</a><b>emu</b> Dave Buckingham's term for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402165536/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_h.htm#herschelloop">Herschel loop</a> that does not emit
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402165536/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_g.htm#glider">gliders</a> (and so is "flightless"). All known Herschel loops of
periods 57, 58, 59 and 61 are emus. See also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402165536/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_q.htm#quetzal">Quetzal</a>.
<p><a name="emulator">:</a><b>emulator</b> Any one of three p4 oscillators that produce <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402165536/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_s.htm#spark">sparks</a>
similar to those produced by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402165536/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_l.htm#lwss">LWSS</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402165536/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_m.htm#mwss">MWSS</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402165536/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_h.htm#hwss">HWSS</a>. See
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402165536/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_l.htm#lwemulator">LW emulator</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402165536/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_m.htm#mwemulator">MW emulator</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402165536/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_h.htm#hwemulator">HW emulator</a>. Larger emulators
are also possible, but they require stabilizing objects to suppress
their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402165536/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_n.htm#nonspark">non-sparks</a> and so are of little use. The emulators were
discovered by Robert Wainwright in June 1980.
<p><a name="engine">:</a><b>engine</b> The active portion of an object (usually a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402165536/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_p.htm#puffer">puffer</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402165536/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_g.htm#gun">gun</a>)
which is considered to actually produce its output, and which
generally permits no variation in how it works. The other parts of
the object are just there to support the engine. For examples, see
