<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324225652/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_n.htm#neighbour">neighbours</a>. See also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324225652/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_o.htm#overpopulation">overpopulation</a>.
<p><a name="unitlifecell">:</a><b>unit Life cell</b> A rectangular pattern, of size greater than 1&times;1,
that can simulate Life in the following sense. The pattern
by itself represents a dead Life cell, and some other pattern
represents a live Life cell. When the plane is tiled by these
two patterns (which then represent the state of a whole Life
universe) they evolve, after a fixed amount of time, into another
tiling of the plane by the same two patterns which correctly
represents the Life generation following the one they initially
represented. It is usual to use capital letters for the simulated
things, so, for example, for the first known unit Life cell
(constructed by David Bell in January 1996), one Generation is
5760 generations, and one Cell is 500&times;500 cells.
<p>In December 2005, Jason Summers constructed an analogous unit
cell for Wolfram's Rule 100, a one-dimensional <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324225652/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_c.htm#cellularautomaton">cellular automaton</a>
that is know be universal.
<p><a name="universalcomputer">:</a><b>universal computer</b> A computer that can compute anything that is
computable. (The concept of computability can be defined in terms
of Turing machines, or by Church's lambda calculus, or by a number
of other methods, all of which can be shown to lead to equivalent
definitions.) The relevance of this to Life is that both Bill
Gosper and John Conway proved early on that it is possible to
construct a universal computer in the Life universe. (To prove
the universality of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324225652/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_c.htm#cellularautomaton">cellular automaton</a> with simple rules was
in fact Conway's aim in Life right from the start.) Conway's proof
is outlined in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324225652/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_w.htm#winningways">Winning Ways</a>, and also in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324225652/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_t.htm#therecursiveuniverse">The Recursive Universe</a>.
<p>Until recently, no universal Life computer had ever been built in
practice, because it would be enormous, even with the improvements
that have been devised since those early proofs. In April 2000,
Paul Rendell completed a Turing machine construction (described
in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324225652/http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~bulitko/F02/papers/tm_words.pdf">http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~bulitko/F02/papers/tm_words.pdf</a>).
This, however, has a finite tape, as opposed to the infinite tape of
a true Turing machine, and is therefore not a universal computer.
But in November 2002, Paul Chapman announced the construction
of a universal computer, details of which can be found at
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324225652/http://www.igblan.free-online.co.uk/igblan/ca/">http://www.igblan.free-online.co.uk/igblan/ca/</a>. This is
a universal register machine based around Dean Hickerson's
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324225652/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_s.htm#slidingblockmemory">sliding block memory</a>.
<p>See also <a href="lex_u.htm#universalconstructor">universal constructor</a>.
<p><a name="universalconstructor">:</a><b>universal constructor</b> A pattern that is capable of constructing
almost any pattern that has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324225652/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_g.htm#glidersynthesis">glider synthesis</a>. This definition is
a bit vague. A precise definition seems impossible because it has
not been proved that all possible glider fleets are constructible.
In any case, a universal constructor ought to be able to construct
itself in order to qualify as such. An outline of Conway's proof
that such a pattern exists can be found in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324225652/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_w.htm#winningways">Winning Ways</a>, and also
in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324225652/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_t.htm#therecursiveuniverse">The Recursive Universe</a>. The key mechanism for the production
of gliders with any given path and timing is known as side-tracking,
and is based on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324225652/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_k.htm#kickbackreaction">kickback reaction</a>. A universal constructor
designed in this way can also function as a universal destructor
- it can delete almost any pattern that can be deleted by gliders.
<p>In May 2004, Paul Chapman and Dave Greene produced a prototype
programmable universal constructor. This is able to construct
objects by means of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324225652/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_s.htm#slowgliderconstruction">slow glider constructions</a>. It likely that
it could be programmed to be construct itself, but the necessary
program would be very large; moreover an additional mechanism would
be needed in order to copy the program.
<p>A universal constructor is most useful when attached to a
<a href="lex_u.htm#universalcomputer">universal computer</a>, which can be programmed to control the
constructor to produce the desired pattern of gliders. In what
follows I will assume that a universal constructor always includes
this computer.
<p>The existence of a universal constructor/destructor has a number of
theoretical consequences.
<p>For example, the constructor could be programmed to make copies of
itself. This is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324225652/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_r.htm#replicator">replicator</a>.
<p>The constructor could even be programmed to make just one copy
of itself translated by a certain amount and then delete itself.
This would be a (very large, very high period) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324225652/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_s.htm#spaceship">spaceship</a>. Any
translation is possible (except that it must not be too small), so
that the spaceship could travel in any direction. It could also
travel slower than any given speed, since we could program it to
perform some time-wasting task (such as repeatedly constructing and
deleting a block) before copying itself. Of course, we could also
choose for it to leave some debris behind, thus making a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324225652/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_p.htm#puffer">puffer</a>.
<p>It is also possible to show that the existence of a universal
constructor implies the existence of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324225652/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_s.htm#stable">stable</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324225652/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_r.htm#reflector">reflector</a>. This
proof is not so easy, however, and is no longer of much significance
now that explicit examples of such reflectors are known.

aligned to period 1, that is, they have arbitrary timing (subject
to some minimum time required for the regulator to recover from the
previous glider).
<p>Paul Chapman constructed the first universal regulator in March
2003. It is adjustable, so that the output can be aligned to any
desired period.
