<p><a name="natural">:</a><b>natural</b> Occurring often in random patterns. There is no precise
measure of naturalness, since the most useful definition of "random"
in this context is open to debate. Nonetheless, it is clear that
objects such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324230400/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_b.htm#block">blocks</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324230400/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_b.htm#blinker">blinkers</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324230400/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_b.htm#beehive">beehives</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324230400/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_g.htm#glider">gliders</a> are

<p><a name="neighbour">:</a><b>neighbour</b> Any of the eight cells adjacent to a given cell. A cell
is therefore not considered to be a neighbour of itself, although
the neighbourhood used in Life does in fact include this cell (see

The name comes from the variety of objects it leaves behind: blocks,
blinkers, beehives, loaves, gliders, ships, boats, long boats,

leading edge falls back in some generations. The first example
(shown below) was found by Hartmut Holzwart in August 1992. This
is p4 and travels at <i>c</i>/4. In April 1994, Holzwart found examples
of p3 spaceships with this property, and this is clearly the
smallest possible period. Another non-monotonic spaceship is
