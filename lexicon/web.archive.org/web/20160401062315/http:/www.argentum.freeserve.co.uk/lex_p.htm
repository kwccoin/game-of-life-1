<p><a name="perturb">:</a><b>perturb</b> To change the fate of an object by reacting it with
other objects. Typically, the other objects are sparks from
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401044240/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_s.htm#spaceship">spaceships</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401044240/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_o.htm#oscillator">oscillators</a>, or are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401044240/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_e.htm#eater">eaters</a> or impacting
spaceships. Perturbations are typically done to turn a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401044240/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_d.htm#dirty">dirty</a>
reaction into a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401044240/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_c.htm#clean">clean</a> one, or to change the products of a reaction.
In many desirable cases the perturbing objects are not destroyed by
the reaction, or else are easily replenished.
<p><a name="perturbation">:</a><b>perturbation</b> See <a href="lex_p.htm#perturb">perturb</a>.
<p><a name="phase">:</a><b>phase</b> A representative generation of a periodic object such as an
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401044240/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_o.htm#oscillator">oscillator</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401044240/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_s.htm#spaceship">spaceship</a>. The number of phases is equal to the
<a href="lex_p.htm#period">period</a> of the object. The phases of an object usually repeat in
the same cyclic sequence forever, although some <a href="lex_p.htm#perturbation">perturbations</a> can
cause a <a href="lex_p.htm#phasechange">phase change</a>.
<p><a name="phasechange">:</a><b>phase change</b> A <a href="lex_p.htm#perturbation">perturbation</a> of a periodic object which causes the
object to skip ahead by one or more <a href="lex_p.htm#phase">phases</a>. If the perturbation
is repeated indefinitely, this can effectively change the <a href="lex_p.htm#period">period</a>
of the object. An example of this, found by Dean Hickerson in
November 1998, is shown below. In this example, the period of the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401044240/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_o.htm#oscillator">oscillator</a> would be 7 if the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401044240/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_m.htm#mold">mold</a> were removed, but the period
is increased to 8 because of the repeated phase changes caused by
the mold's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401044240/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_s.htm#spark">spark</a>.

<p>Phase changing reactions have enabled the construction of
spaceships having periods that were otherwise unknown, and also allow
the construction of period-doubling and period-tripling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401044240/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_c.htm#convoy">convoys</a> to

<p><a name="polyomino">:</a><b>polyomino</b> A finite collection of orthogonally connected cells. The
mathematical study of polyominoes was initiated by Solomon Golomb
in 1953. Conway's early investigations of Life and other cellular
automata involved tracking the histories of small polyominoes,
this being a reasonable way to ascertain the typical behaviour of
different cellular automata when the patterns had to be evolved
by hand rather than by computer. Polyominoes have no special
significance in Life, but their extensive study during the early
years lead to a number of important discoveries and has influenced
the terminology of Life. (Note on spelling: As with "dominoes"
the plural may also be spelt without an e. In this lexicon I have
followed Golomb in using the longer form.)
<p>It is possible for a polyomino to be an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401044240/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_o.htm#oscillator">oscillator</a>. In fact
there are infinitely many examples of such polyominoes, namely the

<p><a name="puffer">:</a><b>puffer</b> An object that moves like a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401044240/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_s.htm#spaceship">spaceship</a>, except that it
leaves debris behind. The first known puffers were found by Bill
Gosper and travelled at <i>c</i>/2 orthogonally (see diagram below for
the very first one, found in 1971). Not long afterwards <i>c</i>/12
diagonal puffers were found (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401044240/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_s.htm#switchengine">switch engine</a>). Discounting
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401044240/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_w.htm#wickstretcher">wickstretchers</a> (which are not puffers in the conventional sense),
no new velocity was obtained after this until David Bell found the
first <i>c</i>/3 orthogonal puffer in April 1996. Since then <i>c</i>/5 orthogonal
puffers have also been found, the first by Tim Coe in May 1997.
Jason Summers built the first <i>c</i>/4 orthogonal puffer in January 1999,
and the first 2<i>c</i>/5 orthogonal puffer in February 1999. Hartmut
Holzwart built the first <i>c</i>/4 diagonal puffer (as opposed to a
wickstretcher) in February 2004.

and is reflected at 90 degrees. The next glider to come along will
not be reflected, but will move the block back to its original
position. The small size and low period of this example make it
useful for constructing glider <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401044240/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_g.htm#gun">guns</a> of certain periods. p7, p22,
