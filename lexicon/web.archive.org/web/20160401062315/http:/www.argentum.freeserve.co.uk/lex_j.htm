original version Jaws had an initial <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224844/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_p.htm#population">population</a> of 150, which at
the time was the smallest for any known pattern with superlinear
growth. In November 1997 Gotts produced a 130-cell Jaws using
some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224844/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_s.htm#switchengine">switch engine</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224844/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_p.htm#predecessor">predecessors</a> found by Paul Callahan. Jaws
has since been beaten by the even smaller <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224844/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_m.htm#mosquito">mosquitoes</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324224844/http://argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_t.htm#teeth">teeth</a>,

<p>Jaws consists of eight pairs of switch engines which produce a
new block-laying switch engine (plus masses of junk) every 10752
generations. It is therefore an MMS breeder.
