<p>As the receding spaceship gets further away the bouncing spaceship
takes longer to complete each cycle, and so the extra spaceships

interval is (<i>v</i>+<i>u</i>)/(<i>v</i>-<i>u</i>) times as long as the previous one. The

where <i>n</i> is the population of one of the extra spaceships (assumed

same manner may be referred to as a caterer.
<p><a name="caterpillar">:</a><b>Caterpillar</b> A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403201317/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_s.htm#spaceship">spaceship</a> that works by laying tracks at its
front end. The only example constructed to date is a p270 17<i>c</i>/45
spaceship built by Gabriel Nivasch in December 2004, based on work
by himself, Jason Summers and David Bell. This Caterpillar has
a population of about 12 million in each generation and was put
together by a computer program that Nivasch wrote. It is by far
the largest and most complex Life object ever constructed.
<p>The 17<i>c</i>/45 Caterpillar is based on the following reaction between
a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403201317/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_p.htm#piheptomino">pi-heptomino</a> and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403201317/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_b.htm#blinker">blinker</a>:

	...............O
</pre>
In this reaction, the pi moves forward 17 cells in the course of 45
generations, while the blinker moves back 6 cells and is rephased.
This reaction has been known for many years, but it was only in
September 2002 that David Bell suggested that it could be used to
build a 17<i>c</i>/45 spaceship, based on a reaction he had found in which
pis crawling along two rows of blinkers interact to emit a glider
every 45 generations. Similar glider-emitting interactions were
later found by Gabriel Nivasch and Jason Summers. The basic idea of
the spaceship design is that streams of gliders created in this way
can be used to construct fleets of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403201317/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_s.htm#standardspaceship">standard spaceships</a> which convey
gliders to the front of the blinker tracks, where they can be used to
build more blinkers.
<p>A different Caterpillar may be possible based on the following
reaction, in which the pattern at top left reappears after 31
generations displaced by (13,1), having produced a new NW-travelling
glider. In this case the tracks would be waves of backward-moving
gliders.

<p><a name="cell">:</a><b>cell</b> The fundamental unit of space in the Life universe. The term is
often used to mean a live cell - the sense is usually clear from the
context.
<p><a name="cellularautomaton">:</a><b>cellular automaton</b> A certain class of mathematical objects of which
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403201317/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_l.htm#life">Life</a> is an example. A cellular automaton consists of a number of
things. First there is a positive integer <i>n</i> which is the dimension
of the cellular automaton. Then there is a finite set of states <i>S</i>,
with at least two members. A state for the whole cellular automaton
is obtained by assigning an element of <i>S</i> to each point of the
<i>n</i>-dimensional lattice <span class="b">Z</span><sup><i>n</i></sup> (where <span class="b">Z</span> is the set of all integers).
The points of <span class="b">Z</span><sup><i>n</i></sup> are usually called cells. The cellular automaton
also has the concept of a neighbourhood. The neighbourhood <i>N</i> of the
origin is some finite (nonempty) subset of <span class="b">Z</span><sup><i>n</i></sup>. The neighbourhood
of any other cell is obtained in the obvious way by translating that
of the origin. Finally there is a transition rule, which is a
function from <i>S</i><sup><i>N</i></sup> to <i>S</i> (that is to say, for each possible state of
the neighbourhood the transition rule specifies some cell state).
The state of the cellular automaton evolves in discrete time, with
the state of each cell at time <i>t</i>+1 being determined by the state
of its neighbourhood at time <i>t</i>, in accordance with the transition
rule.
<p>There are some variations on the above definition. It is common
to require that there be a quiescent state, that is, a state such
that if the whole universe is in that state at generation 0 then it
will remain so in generation 1. (In Life the OFF state is quiescent,
but the ON state is not.) Other variations allow spaces other than
<span class="b">Z</span><sup><i>n</i></sup>, neighbourhoods that vary over space and/or time, probabilistic
or other non-deterministic transition rules, etc.
<p>It is common for the neighbourhood of a cell to be the 3&times;...&times;3
(hyper)cube centred on that cell. (This includes those cases where
the neighbourhood might more naturally be thought of as a proper
subset of this cube.) This is known as the Moore neighbourhood.

All ON states behave the same for the purpose of applying the Life
rule, but additional rules are used to specify the colour of the

<p><a name="colourofaglider">:</a><b>colour of a glider</b> The colour of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403201317/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_g.htm#glider">glider</a> is a property of the
glider which remains constant while the glider is moving along a
straight path, but which can be changed when the glider bounces off
a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403201317/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_r.htm#reflector">reflector</a>. It is an important consideration when building
something using reflectors.
<p>The colour of a glider can be defined as follows. First
choose some cell to be the origin. This cell is then considered
to be white, and all other cells to be black or white in a
checkerboard pattern. (So the cell with coordinates (<i>m</i>,<i>n</i>) is
white if <i>m</i>+<i>n</i> is even, and black otherwise.) Then the colour of
a glider is the colour of its leading cell when it is in a phase
which can be rotated to look like this:
<pre>
	OOO
	..O
	.O.
</pre>
<p>A reflector which does not change the colour of gliders obviously
cannot be used to move a glider onto a path of different colour than
it started on. But a 90-degree reflector which does change the
colour of gliders is similarly limited, as the colour of the
resulting glider will depend only on the direction of the glider,
no matter how many reflectors are used. For maximum flexibility,
therefore, both types of reflector are required.
