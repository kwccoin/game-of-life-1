<p><a name="factory">:</a><b>factory</b> Another word for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402193733/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_g.htm#gun">gun</a>, but not used in the case of glider
guns. The term is also used for a pattern that repeatedly
manufactures objects other than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402193733/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_s.htm#spaceship">spaceships</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402193733/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_r.htm#rake">rakes</a>. In this
case the new objects do not move out of the way, and therefore must
be used up in some way before the next one is made. The following
shows an example of a p144 gun which consists of a p144 block
factory whose output is converted into gliders by a p72 oscillator.
(This gun is David Bell's improvement of the one Bill Gosper found
in July 1994. The p72 oscillator is by Robert Wainwright, 1990, and
the block factory is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402193733/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_a.htm#achimsp144">Achim's p144</a> minus one of its stabilizing
blocks.)

<p><a name="familiarfours">:</a><b>familiar fours</b> Common patterns of four identical objects. The

(4 beehives), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402193733/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_b.htm#blockade">blockade</a> (4 blocks), <a href="lex_f.htm#fleet">fleet</a> (4 ships, although
really 2 ship-ties) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402193733/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_b.htm#bakery">bakery</a> (4 loaves, although really 2
bi-loaves).
<p><a name="fanout">:</a><b>fanout</b> A mechanism that emits two or more objects of some type for
each one that it receives. Typically the objects are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402193733/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_g.htm#glider">gliders</a> or

<p><a name="fastforwardforcefield">:</a><b>Fast Forward Force Field</b> The following reaction found by Dieter
Leithner in May 1994. In the absence of the incoming LWSS the
gliders would simply annihilate one another, but as shown they
allow the LWSS to advance 11 spaces in the course of the next 6
generations. A neat illusion. See also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402193733/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_s.htm#stargate">star gate</a>. (Leithner
named the Fast Forward Force Field in honour of his favourite
science fiction writer, the physicist Robert L. Forward.)

<p><a name="fermatprimecalculator">:</a><b>Fermat prime calculator</b> A pattern constructed by Jason Summers in

are no Fermat primes greater than 65537. The question of whether
or not it really does exhibit infinite growth is therefore equivalent
to a well-known and long-standing unsolved mathematical problem.
It will, however, still be growing at generation 10<sup>2585827975</sup>.

breaking apart, but which nonetheless survives. The exhaust festers
and clings to the back of the puffer/spaceship before breaking off.
The first known frothing puffers were <i>c</i>/2, and most were found by
slightly modifying the back ends of p2 spaceships. A number of
these have periods which are not a multiple of 4 (as with some
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402193733/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_l.htm#linepuffer">line puffers</a>). Paul Tooke has also found <i>c</i>/3 frothing puffers.
<p>The following p78 <i>c</i>/2 frothing puffer was found by Paul Tooke in
April 2001.
