John Conway in 1970. The states are referred to as ON and OFF (or
live and dead). The transition rule is as follows: a cell that is ON
will remain ON in the next generation if and only if exactly 2 or 3
of the 8 adjacent cells are also ON, and a cell that is OFF will turn
ON if and only if exactly 3 of the 8 adjacent cells are ON. (This is
more succinctly stated as: "If 2 of your 8 nearest neighbours are ON,
don't change. If 3 are ON, turn ON. Otherwise, turn OFF.")

algorithm developed by Dean Hickerson in 6502 assembler. Most of
the spaceships and many of the oscillators shown in this lexicon
were found with lifesrc or by Hickerson's original program.
<p>Although lifesrc itself is a command-line program, Jason Summers
has made a GUI version called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403202534/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_w.htm#winlifesearch">WinLifeSearch</a> for Microsoft Windows.
<p>The lifesrc algorithm is only useful for very small periods, as
the amount of computing power required rises rapidly with increasing
period. For most purposes, period 7 is the practical limit with
current hardware.

orthogonal line of cells at right angles to the direction of travel.
The archetypal line puffer was found by Alan Hensel in March 1994,
based on a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403202534/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_s.htm#spaceship">spaceship</a> found earlier that month by Hartmut Holzwart.
The following month Holzwart found a way to make <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403202534/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_e.htm#extensible">extensible</a> <i>c</i>/2
line puffers, and Hensel found a much smaller stabilization the
following day. But in October 1995 Tim Coe discovered that for large
widths these were often unstable, although typically lasting millions
of generations. In May 1996, however, Coe found a way to fix the
instability. The resulting puffers appear to be completely stable
and to exhibit an exponential increase in period as a function of
width, although neither of these things has been proved.
<p>Line puffers have enabled the construction of various difficult
periods for <i>c</i>/2 spaceships and puffers, including occasionally
periods which are not multiples of 4 and which would therefore be
impossible to attain with the usual type of construction based on
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403202534/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_s.htm#standardspaceship">standard spaceships</a>. (See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403202534/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_f.htm#frothingpuffer">frothing puffer</a> for another method
of constructing such periods.) In particular, the first <i>c</i>/2 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403202534/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_r.htm#rake">rake</a>
with period not divisible by 4 was achieved in January 2000 when
David Bell constructed a p42 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403202534/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_b.htm#backrake">backrake</a> by means of line puffers.

line of cells. The first example was constructed by Jason Summers
in March 1999; this was <i>c</i>/12 and used <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403202534/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_s.htm#switchengine">switch engine</a> based puffers
