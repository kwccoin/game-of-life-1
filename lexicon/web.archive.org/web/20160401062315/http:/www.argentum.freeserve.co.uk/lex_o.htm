omniperiodic if it has <a href="lex_o.htm#oscillator">oscillators</a> of all <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401031941/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_p.htm#period">periods</a>.
It is not known if Life is omniperiodic, although this seems
likely. Dave Buckingham's work on Herschel conduits in 1996
(see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401031941/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_m.htm#myexperiencewithbheptominosinoscillators">My Experience with B-heptominos in Oscillators</a>)
reduced the number of unresolved cases to a finite number.
At the time of writing the only periods for which no oscillator is
known are 19, 23, 31, 37, 38, 41, 43 and 53. If we insist that the
oscillator must contain a cell oscillating at the full period, then
34 and 51 should be added to this list. The most recently achieved
periods were all found by Noam Elkies: p49 in August 1999 (a glider
loop using p7 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401031941/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_r.htm#reflector">reflectors</a> built from his new p7 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401031941/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_p.htm#pipsquirter">pipsquirter</a>),
p39 (previously only possible without a p39 cell) in July 2000, and
p27 in November 2002.
<p>Note that if we were to allow infinite oscillators, then all
periods are certainly possible, as any period of 14 or more can
be obtained using a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401031941/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_g.htm#glider">glider</a> (or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401031941/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_l.htm#lwss">LWSS</a>) stream.
