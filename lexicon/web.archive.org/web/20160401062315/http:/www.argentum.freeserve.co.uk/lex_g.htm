cellular automata by John W. Tukey, many years before Life.) It was
known from the start that there are Gardens of Eden in Life, because
of a theorem by Edward Moore that guarantees their existence in
a wide class of cellular automata. Explicit examples have since
been constructed, the first by Roger Banks, et al. at MIT in 1971.
This example was 9 &times; 33. In 1974 J. Hardouin-Duparc et al. at the
University of Bordeaux 1 produced a 6 &times; 122 example. The following
shows a 12 &times; 12 example found by Nicolay Beluchenko in February 2006,

copies of this reaction displaced 2<i>n</i> spaces from one another (for
some <i>n</i>&gt;6) with blocks added between the copies in order to cause the
reaction to occur again halfway through the period. The period of
the resulting infinite oscillator is 8<i>n</i>-20. (Alternatively, in a

gliders and two blocks.)

<p>The following period 30 glider duplicator demonstrates a simple
glider duplicating mechanism found by Dieter Leithner. The input
glider stream comes in from the upper left, and the output glider
streams leave at the upper and lower right. One of the output glider
streams is inverted, so an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402020111/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_i.htm#inlineinverter">inline inverter</a> is required to complete
the duplicator.

since they (along with <a href="lex_g.htm#gliderturner">glider turners</a>) provide a means to clean up
many dirty puffers by duplicating and turning output gliders so as to
impact into the exhaust to clean it up.
<p>Glider duplicators (and turners) are known for backward gliders
using p2 <i>c</i>/2 spaceships, and for forward gliders using p3 <i>c</i>/3
spaceships. These are the most general duplicators for these speeds.

<p><a name="gliderless">:</a><b>gliderless</b> A <a href="lex_g.htm#gun">gun</a> is said to be gliderless if it does not use
<a href="lex_g.htm#glider">gliders</a>. The purist definition would insist that a glider does
not appear anywhere, even incidentally. For a long time the only
known way to construct <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402020111/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_l.htm#lwss">LWSS</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402020111/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_m.htm#mwss">MWSS</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402020111/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_h.htm#hwss">HWSS</a> guns involved
gliders, and it was not until April 1996 that Dieter Leithner
constructed the first gliderless gun (a p46 LWSS gun).
<p>The following diagram shows the p44 MWSS gun that Dieter Leithner
discovered (in a somewhat larger form) in April 1997. This is the
smallest known gliderless gun, and also the smallest known MWSS
gun. It is based on an important p44 oscillator discovered by Dave
Buckingham in early 1992, shown here in an improved form found in
January 2005 by Jason Summers using a new p4 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402020111/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_s.htm#sparker">sparker</a> by Nicolay
Beluchenko. Note that a glider shape appears in this gun for
three consecutive generations, but always as part of a larger
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402020111/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_c.htm#cluster">cluster</a>, so even a purist would regard this gun as gliderless.

In June 1998 Stephen Silver found syntheses for some of the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402020111/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_c.htm#cordership">Corderships</a> (although it was not until July 1999 that Jason Summers
used this to build a Cordership gun). In May 2000, Noam Elkies
suggested that a 2<i>c</i>/5 spaceship found by Tim Coe in May 1996 might be
a candidate for glider synthesis. Initial attempts to construct a
synthesis for this spaceship got fairly close, but it was only in
March 2003 that Summers and Elkies managed to find a way perform the
crucial last step. Summers then used the new synthesis to build a
<i>c</i>/2 forward rake for the 2<i>c</i>/5 spaceship; this was the first example
in Life of a rake which fires spaceships that travel in the same
direction as the rake but more slowly.
<p>A 3-glider synthesis of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402020111/http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_p.htm#pentadecathlon">pentadecathlon</a> is shown in the diagram
below. This was found in April 1997 by Heinrich Koenig and came as
a surprise, as it was widely assumed that anything using just three
gliders would already be known.
